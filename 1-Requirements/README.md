# Requirements

So you have decided to try and make a client for eaglercraft 1.8 and here you are. For this tutorial you will need:
- A decent enough computer running 64-bit Windows, MacOS or linux (I will not help anyone using chromeOS, I know most people have chromebooks but I simply will not support it)
- Java version 11 and up
- Something to edit files (Notepad should work too)
- A ZIP archive manager (WinRAR, 7-zip)
